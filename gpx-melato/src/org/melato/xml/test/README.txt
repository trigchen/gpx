This is a test for using the XML tag delegation framework.

contacts.xml is a file representing contacts.

A contact is a record of a person's contact information.

A contact has:
* A name
* A phone #
* An email address
* A list of notes.  Each note is a string.

The test reads contacts from an xml file, creates a list of Contact objects, and prints them out.
